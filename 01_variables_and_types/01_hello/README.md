## Hello World
- Elixir has _modules_, those are the "packages" that you can import and use it's functions
- In this example we'll be using the [IO Module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html)
- ```elixir
    /* This will print Hello World */
    IO.puts "Hello, World"
  ```
- At first glance it looks like Elixir don't require a _main scope_ to run
